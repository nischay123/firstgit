<p>WINGS OF FIRE
An Autobiography
AVUL PAKIR JAINULABDEEN ABDUL KALAM has
come to personally represent to many of his countrymen the<br>
best aspects of Indian life. Born in 1931, the son of a little
educated boatowner in Rameswaram, Tamilnadu, he had
an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating
in the highest civilian award of India, the Bharat Ratna.
As chief of the country’s defence research and<br>
development programme, Kalam demonstrated the great
potential for dynamism and innovation that existed in
seemingly moribund research establishments. This is the
story of Kalam’s rise from obscurity and his personal <br>
professional struggles, as well as the story of Agni, Prithvi,
Akash, Trishul a nd Nag - missiles that have become
household names in India and that have raised the nation to
the level of a missile power of international recokoning.
At the same time as he has helped create India’s
awesome weaponry, Kalam has maintained the ascetic<br>
rigour of his personal life, working 18 hours a day and<br>
practicing the veena. With characteristic modesty, Kalam
ascribes the greatness of his achievement to the influence
of his teachers and mentors. He describes the struggles of<br>
his boyhood and youth, bringing alive everyday life in a
small town in South India and the inspirational role of<br>
educators. He describes the role of visionary Indian
scientists, such as Dr Vikram Sarabhai, and of the creation<br>
of a coordinated network of research institutions. This is
also the saga of independent India’s struggle for
technological self sufficiency and defensive autonomy – a
story as much about politics, domestic and international, as
it is about science.<br>
Arun Tiwari worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for
over a decade in the Defence Research and Development
Laboratory (DRDL), Hyderabad. He is currently Director,
Cardiovascular Technology Institute, Hyderabad, where <br>
is pursuing Dr Kalam’s vision of developing cost-effective
medical devices using indigenous defence technology.
Dr Kalam is now India’s President. He was elected to
India’s office by a huge majority in 2002.<br>
To the memory of my parents
My Mother<br>
Sea waves, golden sand, pilgrims’ faith,<br>
Rameswaram Mosque Street, all merge into one,
My Mother!<br><br><br>
You come to me like heaven’s caring arms.
I remember the war days when life was challenge and toil—<br><br>
Miles to walk, hours before sunrise,
Walking to take lessons from the saintly teacher near <br><br>
temple. Again miles to the Arab teaching school,<br><br>
Climb sandy hills to Railway Station Road,<br><br>
Collect, distribute newspapers to temple city citizens,
Few hours after sunrise, going to school.<br><br>
Evening, business time before study at night.<br><br>
All this pain of a young boy,<br><br>
My Mother you transformed into pious strength<br><br>
With kneeling and bowing five timesFor the Grace of the Almighty only, My Mother.
Your strong piety is your children’s strength,<br><br>
You always shared your best with whoever needed the
most, You always gave, and gave with faith in Him.<br><br>
I still remember the day when I was ten,<br><br>
Sleeping on your lap to the envy of my elder brothers and<br><br>
sisters It was full moon night, my world only you knew<br><br>
Mother! My Mother!
When at midnight I woke with tears falling on my knee You<br><br>
knew the pain of your child, My Mother.
Your caring hands, tenderly removing the pain<br><br>
Your love, your care, your faith gave me strength<br><br>
To face the world without fear and with His strength.
We will meet again on the great Judgement Day, My
Mother!<br><br>

Preface
I<br><br>
have worked under Dr APJ Abdul Kalam for over a<br><br>
decade. This might seem to disqualify me as his
biographer, and I certainly had no notion of being one. One<br><br>
day, while speaking to him, I<br><br>
asked him if he had a message for young Indians. His
message fascinated me. Later, I mustered the courage to
ask him about his recollections so that I could pen them
down before they were buried irretrievably under the sands
of time.<br><br>
We had a long series of sittings late into the night and
early under the fading stars of dawn—all somehow stolen
from his very busy schedule of eighteen hours a day. The
profundity and range of his ideas mesmerized me. He had
tremendous vitality and obviously received immense
pleasure from the world of ideas. His conversation was not
always easy to follow, but was always fresh and stimulating.
There were complexities, subtleties, and intriguing
metaphors and subplots in his narrative, but gradually the
unfolding of his brilliant mind took the form of a continuous
discourse.
When I sat down to write this book, I felt that it required
greater skills than I possessed. But realising the
importance of this task and regarding it an honour to have
been permitted to attempt it, I prayed earnestly for the
courage and calibre to complete it.
This book is written for the ordinary people of India for
whom Dr Kalam has an immense affection, and of whom
Dr Kalam is certainly one. He has an intuitive rapport with
the humblest and simplest people, an indication of his own
simplicity and innate spirituality.
For myself, writing this book has been like a pilgrimage.
Through Dr Kalam, I was blessed with the revelation that
the real joy of living can be found in only one way—in one’s
communion with an eternal source of hidden knowledge
within oneself—which each individual is bidden to seek and
find for himself or herself. Many of you may never meet Dr
Kalam in person, but I hope you will enjoy his company
through this book, and that he will become your spiritual
friend.
I could include in this book only a few incidents among
the many narrated to me by Dr Kalam. In fact, this bookprovides only a thumbnail sketch of Dr Kalam’s life. It is
quite possible that certain important incidents have been
inadvertently dropped and that the contribution of some
individuals to the projects co-ordinated by Dr Kalam has
gone unrecorded. Since a quarter-century of professional
life separates me from Dr Kalam, some important issues
might also have remained unrecorded or have been
distorted. I am solely responsible for such shortcomings,
which are, of course, completely unintentional.

Arun Tiwari
This book is being released at a time when India’s
technological endeavours, to assert its sovereignty and
strengthen its security, are questioned by many in the world.
Historically, people have always fought among themselves
on one issue or another. Prehistorically, battles were fought
over food and shelter. With the passage of time, wars were
waged over religious and ideological beliefs; and now the
dominant struggle of sophisticated warfare is for economic
and technological supremacy. Consequently, economic
and technological supremacy is equated with political
power and world control.
Afew nations who have grown very strong
technologically, over the past few centuries, have wrested
control, for their own purposes. These major powers have
become the self-proclaimed leaders of the new world
order. What does a country of one billion people, like India,
do in such a situation? We have no other option but to be
technologically strong. But, can India be a leader in the field
of technology? My answer is an emphatic ‘Yes’. And let me
validate my answer by narrating some incidents from my
life.
When I first began the reminiscences that have gone
into this book, I was uncertain about which of my memories
were worth narrating or were of any relevance at all. My
childhood is precious to me, but would it be of interest to
anyone else? Was it worth the reader’s while, I wondered,
to know about the tribulations and triumphs of a smalltown
boy? Of the straitened circumstances of my schooldays, the
odd jobs I did to pay my school fees, and how my decision
to become a vegetarian was partly due to my financialconstraints as a college student—why should these be of
any interest to the general public? In the end, I was
convinced that these were relevant, if not for anything else
but because they tell something of the story of modern
India, as individual destiny and the social matrix in which it
is embedded cannot be seen in isolation. Having been
persuaded of this, it did seem germane to include the
accounts of my frustrated attempt to become an Air Force
pilot and of how I became, instead of the Collector my
father dreamed I would be, a rocket engineer.
Finally, I decided to describe the individuals who had a
profound influence on my life. This book is also by way of a
submission of thanks, therefore, to my parents and
immediate family, and to the teachers and preceptors I was
fortunate to have had, both as a student and in my
professional life. It is also a tribute to the unflagging
enthusiasm and efforts of my young colleagues who helped
to realise our collective dreams. The famous words of Isaac
Newton about standing on the shoulders of giants are valid
for every scientist and I certainly owe a great debt of
knowledge and inspiration to the distinguished lineage of
Indian scientists, that included Vikram Sarabhai, Satish
Dhawan and Brahm Prakash. They played major roles in
my life and in the story of Indian science.
I completed sixty years of age on 15 October 1991. I had
decided to devote my retirement to fulfilling what I saw as
my duties in the
sphere of social service. Instead, two things happened
simultaneously. First, I agreed to continue in government
service for another three years and, next, a young
colleague, Arun Tiwari, requested me to share my
reminiscences with him, so that he could record them. He
was someone who had been working in my laboratory
since 1982, but I had never really known him well until the
February of 1987 when I visited him at the Intensive
Coronary Care Unit of the Nizam’s Institute of Medical
Sciences in Hyderabad. He was a mere 32 years old, but
was fighting valiantly for his life. I asked him if there was
anything he wanted me to do for him. “Give me your
blessings, sir,” he said, “so that I may have a longer life and
can complete at least one of your projects.”
The young man’s dedication moved me and I prayed for
his recovery all night. The Lord answered my prayers and
Tiwari was able to get back to work in a month. He did an
excellent job in helping to realise the Akash missile
airframe from scratch within the short space of three years.
He then took up the task of chronicling my story. Over the
last year, he patiently transcribed the bits and pieces of my
story and converted them into a fluent narrative. He also
went through my personal library meticulously and selected
from among the pieces of poetry those that I had marked
while reading, and included them in the text.
This story is an account, I hope, not just of my personal
triumphs and tribulations but of the successes and
setbacks of the science establishment in modern India,
struggling to establish itself in the technological forefront. It
is the story of national aspiration and of cooperative
endeavour. And, as I see it, the saga of India’s search for
scientific self-sufficiency and technological competence is
a parable for our times.
Each individual creature on this beautiful planet is
created by God to fulfil a particular role. Whatever I have
achieved in life is through His help, and an expression of
His will. He showered His grace on me through some
outstanding teachers and colleagues, and when I pay mytributes to these fine persons, I am merely praising His
glory. All these rockets and missiles are His work through a
small person called Kalam, in order to tell the several-
million mass of India, to never feel small or helpless. We
are all born with a divine fire in us. Our efforts should be to
give wings to this fire and fill the world with the glow of its
goodness.
May God bless you!
APJ Abdul Kalam</p>
